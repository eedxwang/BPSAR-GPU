## Introduction

The backprojection (BP) or so called Beam Formation (BF) Imaging Algorithm is designed in this project. The BP algorithm firstly is stated in the CT area, then the same idea is used in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

The Key idea of BP algorithm is coherently calculating the contribution of each pulse to each pixels, which comprehensively states in Duersch PhD dissertation [3] or Jakowatz's paper [4]. Comparing to the well known Range-Doppler algorithm for ISAR/SAR, the most important advantage of the BP algorithm is non-distortion in wide angle, in other word, extremely high cross range resolution. However, the BP algorithm is extremely time-consumption. Even though several BP algorithm based on the sub-aperature algorithm by UCBerkely, the BPA is still to slow for very large scene.

Thus, in this project, I designed the BPA algorithm based on the CUDA acceleration.

## Requirement

The project is compiled in VS2015 with CUDA 8.0. Due to the stability of CUDA, author can't guarantee that this BPSAR-GPU would work or give correct answer. 

The author's platform is Intel i7 4790k, 8GB and GTX970. There is a macro which, when the number of CUDA cores is not sufficient, user could adjust the number of simultaneously running cores. (`TODO: The code automaticaly recoginizes the graphic card and changes cores used.`) 

However, the code is still very memory-consumption, especially for the GPU memory. That is because the BPA needs to calculate the FFT for every pulse with N multiple points in order to give a better smooth image. Thus, when the code gives all-zero or all-non-sense result, please low down the multiplier N or consider change a GPU. (`TODO: Author is thinking adding new function to use the time in exchange the memory`)
